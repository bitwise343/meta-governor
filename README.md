# MetaGovernor
The MetaGovernor contract is the target of vote delegation. It uses modular admin contracts to test different mechanisms for controlling voting and proposing.

# MultisigAdmin
Use a multisig to control voting and proposing.

# CommitmentAdmin
New proposals require a three day delay, giving delegators a window of time to remove their delegates from the MetaGovernor contract or giving would-be delegators a window of time to add their delegates to the contract.
