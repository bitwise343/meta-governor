# MetaGovernor
Blockchain@UCLA participates in DAO voting on Aave, Compound, and Uni. This contract may evolve to become our portal to decentralized blockchain governance.

# Proposal Commitments
Before we submit a new proposal to any governance platform, we use a proposal hashing scheme to store a commitment to the proposal we wish to initiate. This gives delegators a 3 day period to un-delegate their votes in the case that they do not fully support an incoming proposal from Blockchain@UCLA. This does not apply to votes on already active proposals, however, just new proposals
